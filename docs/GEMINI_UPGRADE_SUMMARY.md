# PulsePlan Canvas Extension - Gemini AI Upgrade Summary

## Overview

The PulsePlan Canvas extension has been completely rewritten to leverage Google's Gemini AI for intelligent assignment extraction instead of traditional pattern-based scraping. This upgrade provides significantly improved accuracy, adaptability, and robustness across different Canvas layouts and themes.

## üöÄ Key Improvements

### Before (Pattern-Based)

- ‚ùå Hard-coded CSS selectors for specific Canvas elements
- ‚ùå Brittle extraction that breaks with layout changes
- ‚ùå Limited to known Canvas page structures
- ‚ùå Manual maintenance required for new Canvas versions
- ‚ùå Poor handling of custom Canvas themes

### After (AI-Powered)

- ‚úÖ **Intelligent Content Recognition**: AI understands content context, not just DOM structure
- ‚úÖ **Adaptive Scraping**: Works with any Canvas layout, theme, or custom configuration
- ‚úÖ **Future-Proof**: Adapts to Canvas updates without code changes
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Accuracy**: AI provides confidence scores and better data extraction
- ‚úÖ **Fallback Support**: Gracefully falls back to pattern-based extraction if AI fails

## üß† AI-Powered Architecture

### 1. Smart Page Analysis

```javascript
function determinePageContext() {
  // Intelligently determines Canvas page type:
  // - Dashboard, Course assignments, Calendar, Modules, etc.
  // - Provides context to AI for better extraction
}
```

### 2. Content Area Detection

```javascript
function getRelevantContentAreas() {
  // Identifies areas likely to contain assignment data
  // - Reduces noise for AI processing
  // - Improves extraction accuracy and speed
}
```

### 3. Gemini AI Integration

```javascript
async function sendToGeminiService(pageData) {
  // Sends page content to Gemini API for intelligent extraction
  // - Handles both text and visual analysis
  // - Returns structured assignment data with confidence scores
}
```

### 4. Intelligent Caching

```javascript
let cachedResults = new Map();
// Smart caching based on page content hash
// Reduces API calls and improves performance
```

## üéØ AI Extraction Process

### Step 1: Page Context Detection

```javascript
const context = determinePageContext();
// Returns: 'dashboard', 'course_assignments', 'calendar', etc.
```

### Step 2: Content Capture

```javascript
const pageData = await capturePageData();
// Captures relevant HTML content, limiting size for API efficiency
// Optionally captures screenshots for visual analysis
```

### Step 3: AI Processing

```javascript
const aiData = await gemini.extractScheduleData({
  html: pageData.html,
  screenshot: pageData.screenshot,
  extractionType: "canvas_assignments",
  context: pageData.context,
});
```

### Step 4: Result Processing

```javascript
const assignments = processAIResults(aiData);
// Converts AI responses to structured assignment data
// Validates and cleans extracted information
// Provides confidence scores for each assignment
```

## üìä Enhanced Data Structure

### AI-Extracted Assignment Object

```javascript
{
  id: "canvas_ai_123456",
  title: "Enhanced Assignment Title",
  course: "Course Name",
  description: "AI-extracted description",
  dueDate: "2024-01-15T23:59:00Z",
  url: "https://canvas.../assignments/123",
  priority: "high", // AI-inferred
  estimatedMinutes: 120, // AI-estimated
  type: "assignment", // AI-classified
  status: "pending", // AI-determined
  confidence: 0.95, // AI confidence score
  extractionMethod: "ai", // or "fallback"
  scraped: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Reliability Features

### 1. Smart Caching

- Caches results based on page content hash
- Reduces API calls for identical content
- Improves performance and reduces costs

### 2. Request Throttling

- 5-second cooldown between AI requests
- Prevents API rate limiting
- Reduces server load

### 3. Graceful Fallback

- Falls back to pattern-based extraction if AI fails
- Ensures functionality even during AI service outages
- Maintains basic extraction capabilities

### 4. Error Handling

- Comprehensive error logging
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry mechanisms

## üîÑ Smart Detection & Monitoring

### Page Change Detection

```javascript
function setupPageChangeDetection() {
  // Monitors for:
  // - URL changes (SPA navigation)
  // - DOM content changes
  // - Relevant element additions
  // Automatically triggers re-extraction when needed
}
```

### Performance Optimization
