### How AI Extraction Works

The extension uses Google's Gemini AI to:

- Analyze the entire page structure and content
- Identify assignment titles, due dates, courses, and other relevant information
- Extract data even from complex or non-standard Canvas layouts
- Provide confidence scores for each extracted assignment
- Fall back to traditional pattern matching if AI service is unavailable

## Development

The extension consists of several key components:

- `manifest.json`: Extension configuration and permissions
- `popup.html/js`: User interface for the extension popup with AI status indicators
- `content.js`: **AI-powered content script** that uses Gemini API for intelligent extraction
- `upload.js`: Background service worker that sends data to the PulsePlan API

### AI-Powered Architecture

The new AI-powered extraction system:

1. **Smart Page Analysis**: Determines Canvas page type (dashboard, assignments, courses, etc.)
2. **Content Area Detection**: Identifies relevant content areas that likely contain assignment data
3. **Gemini API Integration**: Sends page content to Google's Gemini AI for intelligent extraction
4. **Result Processing**: Converts AI responses into structured assignment data
5. **Caching System**: Intelligently caches results to minimize API calls
6. **Fallback Support**: Uses traditional pattern matching if AI service is unavailable

### Key Features

- **Adaptive Scraping**: Works with any Canvas layout or theme
- **Confidence Scoring**: AI provides confidence scores for extracted data
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with graceful fallbacks
- **Performance Optimization**: Smart caching and request throttling

## Authentication

The extension uses a JWT token stored in `chrome.storage` to authenticate with the PulsePlan API.
Make sure you're logged in to PulsePlan before attempting to sync.
